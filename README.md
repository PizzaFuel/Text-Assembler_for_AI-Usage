# Text-Assembler_for_AI-Usage

## Introduction
The "Text-Assembler_for_AI-Usage" script by PizzaFuel is designed to streamline the analysis of codebases and text-based project assets. It recursively traverses a directory, lists all files, and compiles the contents of text and code files into a single output file. This tool is ideal for preparing project data for analysis with tools like ChatGPT and other Large Language Models or for archival purposes.

## Installation
This script does not require installation. However, it runs on Python and requires Python 3.6 or newer.

To use this script, clone the repository or download the `.py` file directly to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PizzaFuel/Text-Assembler_for_AI-Usage.git
```

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage
Navigate to the directory containing Text-Assembler_for_AI-Usage.py and run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python Text-Assembler_for_AI-Usage.py
```

Follow the prompts to specify the root directory of your project and whether you wish to include a project info section in the output file. The script will generate a detailed list and content summary of all text files in the specified directory, saving the output to your Desktop or another specified location. You can also decide to ignore files with ".git" in their path since these tend to not help AI's much in understanding the project.

## Context
The genesis of "Text-Assembler_for_AI-Usage" occurred during the development of a custom GPT tailored for the Playdate game development in Lua. This endeavor and the challenges and insights it brought forth are elaborated upon in the PizzaTime Article featured in Unkrank'd Magazine Issue 3. The article provides a deep dive into the process and thinking behind the creation of the AI and this script.
